#Day 32  --First React Assignment

#Trading Cards

##Process
1. Map out wireframes, user events, data models, and routes
2. Break application into user functional components
3. Code/hook up router with appropriate routes
4. Code components to piece together main page

##Troubleshooting
1. Difficulty with rendering dynamic pieces of data to DOM with react
2. Difficulty with linking dynamic IDs

##How can it grow?
1. Use backend application or API to render data from rather than using static data
2. Make the forms actually submit information rather than just console logging
