#React Components Practice. 
* Use Backbone Router and React Components along with React DOM to create a trading card app.
* Create static data (just a plain array of objects you wrote) with at least 5 different objects, each having at least 5 properties.
* Create a 'navigation' component and render it to the DOM. It should render links for each of your 'trading cards' as well as a link to the 'create new card' form (see below) and login/signup.
* When a trading card route is hit, render a 'trading card' component to the DOM, using the relevant object from your data to fill in the dynamic pieces of the card.
* When the 'create new card' route is hit, render a form that enables a user to enter information to create a new card.
* When the 'login' or 'signup' routes are hit, appropriate form components should be rendered to the DOM.
